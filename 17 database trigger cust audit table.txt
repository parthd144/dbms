Write a database trigger on customer( cust_id, c_name, addr) table. The System should keep track of the records that are being updated or deleted. The old value of updated or deleted records should be added in cust_Audit table.

CREATE TABLE cust_Audit(
 audit_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
 cust_id INT,
 c_name VARCHAR(50),
 addr VARCHAR(100),
 audit_date TIMESTAMP,
 action VARCHAR(50)
);

create a trigger to log the changes whenever an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operation is performed on the customer table:
CREATE TRIGGER customer_after_insert
AFTER INSERT ON customer
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
 INSERT INTO cust_Audit(cust_id, c_name, addr, audit_date, action)
 VALUES(NEW.cust_id, NEW.c_name, NEW.addr, NOW(), 'INSERT');
END;

CREATE TRIGGER customer_after_update
AFTER UPDATE ON customer
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
 INSERT INTO cust_Audit(cust_id, c_name, addr, audit_date, action)
 VALUES(OLD.cust_id, OLD.c_name, OLD.addr, NOW(), 'UPDATE');
END;

CREATE TRIGGER customer_after_delete
AFTER DELETE ON customer
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
 INSERT INTO cust_Audit(cust_id, c_name, addr, audit_date, action)
 VALUES(OLD.cust_id, OLD.c_name, OLD.addr, NOW(), 'DELETE');
END;
