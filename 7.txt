Write a SQL statement to create a table job_history including columns employee_id, start_date, end_date, job_id and department_id and make sure that, the employee_id column does not contain any duplicate value at the time of insertion and the foreign key column job_id contain only those values which are exists in the jobs table. Consider table Job (job_id,job_title.min_sal,max_sal)

CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY
);

CREATE TABLE departments (
    department_id INT PRIMARY KEY
);

CREATE TABLE jobs (
    job_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    job_title VARCHAR(50),
    min_sal DECIMAL(10, 2),
    max_sal DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

CREATE TABLE job_history (
    employee_id INT,
    start_date DATE,
    end_date DATE,
    job_id INT,
    department_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (employee_id, start_date),
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employees(employee_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (job_id) REFERENCES jobs(job_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id)
);
